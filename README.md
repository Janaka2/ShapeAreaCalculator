# Shape Area Calculator

A simple Java application that demonstrates the usage of pattern matching for switch expressions (JEP 406) introduced in JDK 17. The application calculates the area of different shapes: Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you need to have JDK 17 or later installed on your system.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shape-area-calculator.git

java ShapeAreaCalculator

## Application Structure
The application contains the following Java files:

- Shape.java: An abstract class that represents a generic shape.
- Circle.java: A record class that represents a Circle shape and extends the Shape class.
- Rectangle.java: A record class that represents a Rectangle shape and extends the Shape class.
- Triangle.java: A record class that represents a Triangle shape and extends the Shape class.
- ShapeAreaCalculator.java: The main class that demonstrates the usage of pattern matching for switch expressions to calculate the areas of different shapes.
